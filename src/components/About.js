          <h4>Hello world !</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            I am a software engineer actively broadening my expertise by
            pursuing a Master's in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern
            University.
          </p>

          <p>
            I previously served at Sony India, where I had the oppurtunity to
            make contributions to a critical tool utilized by Sony Pictures for
            processing movies and videos prior to their release, known as
            "Viewing Experience." During my tenure, I also developed an in-house
            application for the team. This experience was instrumental in
            enhancing my skills in full-stack technologies and laying a solid
            foundation for my career in software engineering.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have a strong interest in contributing to open-source projects,
            exploring distributed systems, and delving into cloud computing. I
            am actively learning and eager to embark on my journey in these
            domains.
          </p>

          <p>
            Regarding technical skills, I have expertise in languages such as
            Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript. My proficiency extends to backend
            technologies like Node.js, Rest APIs, and the .NET Framework, as
            well as the Django Framework. In frontend development, I am skilled
            in HTML5, CSS3, React.js, XML, and XAML. Additionally, I have
            experience working with databases, including MongoDB, SQL, MySQL,
            and MSSQL.
          </p>

          <p>
            Excited about the prospect of connecting with like-minded
            individuals, contributing to meaningful projects, and collaborating
            to build innovative solutions that make a positive impact. Looking
            forward to exploring new opportunities, sharing insights, and
            collectively creating something cool.
